# 32-bit Microsoft Assembly (MASM) Projects

* FizzBuzz - Classic programming interview question "FizzBuzz" written in 32-bit MASM.
* Tic-Tac-Toe - Simple game of 2-play tic-tac-toe.
* Recursive Quicksort Algorithm - Sorts an array of floating-point numbers.
* Signed Integer Validation - Validates console input from Win32 API calls (no library helper) and validates to signed 32-bit integers.
* Composites & Primes - Calculates and displays all of the composite numbers from 1 to N. Coding efficiency is gained by only checking against prime numbers. 

To compile, you will need the Kip Irvine libraries for MASM found here: http://kipirvine.com/asm/gettingStartedVS2017/index.htm
